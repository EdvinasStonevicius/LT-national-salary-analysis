# LT-national-salary-analysis
The project is currently under development. I  [created](SQL/01_create.sql),  [cleaned](SQL/02_tidy.sql) data and did [preliminary analysis](SQL/03_Analysis.sql) with MySQL. I used Python for [deeper exploration](python/01-Initial_exploration.ipynb), feature engineering [feature engineering](python/02-Feature_engineering.ipynb) and development of various ML models [feature engineering](/python). The next step will be the tuning of ML models and selection of most promising ones for analysis of hourly rate contributing factors and uncertainties.
