# LT-national-salary-analysis
The project is currently under development. I  [created](SQL/01_create.sql),  [cleaned](SQL/02_tidy.sql) data and did [preliminary analysis](SQL/03_Analysis.sql) with MySQL. I used Python for deeper exploration [deeper exploration](python/01-Initial_exploration.ipynb), feature engineering and development of various ML models. The next step will be the development of ML model to predict the hourly rate based on employee age, gender, education and profession.
